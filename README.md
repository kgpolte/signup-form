# signup-form
An assignment for the Odin Project - simple sign up form


## Features

### Input validation

- The form uses javascript to implement client-side validation of required fields, email format, and password matching.

- The only password requirements currently are that they must match and the fields must not be empty. This could be improved in future versions to require a minimum length, special characters, numbers, etc...

- Fields are styled appropriately to visually indicate the location of invalid inputs to users, and an error message is displayed to direct the user to the input.

- The focused input is styled to make it stand out from the form.

## Data Usage

- The "Create Account" button and "Log in" link do not link to anywhere or send the input data.
